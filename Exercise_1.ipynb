        "In theory, a proof-of-work blockchain is able to have a realtime difficulty adjustment as the blockchain is reliant on how long it takes for the block to get solved. This is the 'difficulty' aspect that helps the block from being solved too fast. By having a realtime difficulty adjustment, the blockchain is able to control how fast each block is being solved. If it turns out that its taking too long to solve a block (For example, Bitcoin adjusts its difficulty every 2016 blocks) , it will lower the difficulty to ensure the block can be solved in less time than the previous block. This can be said if the block is solved too fast; it will increase the difficulty for the next block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some advantages of this setup are faster response times where block times are able to adjust depending on the number of miners entering and exiting the blockchain. This is extremely beneficial for small blockchains where the number of miners are low and few which requires a large amount of mining power to output blocks but at the same time, not letting the blockchain output too many blocks at once. However, this can result in a vulnerable blockchain as miners are able to exploit shorter times as a result of a lower difficulty by manipulting fake timestamps. Oscilating difficulty levels can also make the network less predictable and easier for miners to exploit the blockchain."
